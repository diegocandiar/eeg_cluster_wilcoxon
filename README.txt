# eeg_cluster_wilcoxon

This pack of functions correspond to the EEG cluster permutation analysis.

For the function performing the cluster permutation refer to ft_statfun_cluster.
To visualize examples presented in the manuscript refer to example_ERP and example_EEG.
Additional files in the folder correspond to preprocessed data formated in the Fieldtrip struct, and EEG channels' locations and neighbouring definitions.
